`aioridwell` is a Python 3, asyncio-friendly library for interacting with
[Ridwell][ridwell] to view information on upcoming recycling pickups.

# Installation

```bash
pip install aioridwell
```

# Python Versions

`aioridwell` is currently supported on:

- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12

# Usage

## Creating and Using a Client

The `Client` is the primary method of interacting with the API:

```python
import asyncio

from aioridwell import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")
    # ...


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to the API with each coroutine. If
you are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second
of runtime savings possible), an [`aiohttp`][aiohttp] `ClientSession` can be used for
connection pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aiowatttime import Client


async def main() -> None:
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session=session)
        # ...


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Getting the User's Dashboard URL

```python
import asyncio

from aioridwell import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")
    client.get_dashboard_url()
    # >>> https://www.ridwell.com/users/userId1/dashboard


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Getting Accounts

Getting all accounts associated with this email address is easy:

```python
import asyncio

from aioridwell import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")

    accounts = await client.async_get_accounts()
    # >>> {"account_id_1": RidwellAccount(...), ...}


asyncio.run(main())
```

The `RidwellAccount` object comes with some useful properties:

- `account_id`: the Ridwell ID for the account
- `address`: the address being serviced
- `email`: the email address on the account
- `full_name`: the full name of the account owner
- `phone`: the phone number of the account owner
- `subscription_id`: the Ridwell ID for the primary subscription
- `subscription_active`: whether the primary subscription is active

## Getting Pickup Events

Getting pickup events associated with an account is easy, too:

```python
import asyncio

from aioridwell import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")

    accounts = await client.async_get_accounts()
    for account in accounts.values():
        events = await account.async_get_pickup_events()
        # >>> [RidwellPickupEvent(...), ...]

        # You can also get just the next pickup event from today's date:
        next_event = await account.async_get_next_pickup_event()
        # >>> RidwellPickupEvent(...)


asyncio.run(main())
```

The `RidwellPickupEvent` object comes with some useful properties:

- `pickup_date`: the date of the pickup (in `datetime.date` format)
- `pickups`: a list of `RidwellPickup` objects
- `state`: an `EventState` enum whose name represents the current state of the pickup event

Likewise, the `RidwellPickup` object comes with some useful properties:

- `category`: a `PickupCategory` enum whose name represents the type of pickup
- `name`: the name of the item being picked up
- `offer_id`: the Ridwell ID for this particular offer
- `priority`: the pickup priority
- `product_id`: the Ridwell ID for this particular product
- `quantity`: the amount of the product being picked up

### Opting Into or Out Of a Pickup Event

```python
import asyncio

from aioridwell import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")

    accounts = await client.async_get_accounts()
    for account in accounts.values():
        events = await account.async_get_pickup_events()
        # >>> [RidwellPickupEvent(...), ...]

        await events[0].async_opt_in()
        await events[0].async_opt_out()


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Calculating a Pickup Event's Estimated Cost

```python
import asyncio

from aioridwell import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")

    accounts = await client.async_get_accounts()
    for account in accounts.values():
        events = await account.async_get_pickup_events()
        # >>> [RidwellPickupEvent(...), ...]

        event_1_cost = await events[0].async_get_estimated_cost()
        # >>> 22.00


asyncio.run(main())
```
